# CodeBook

This book describes all variables, data, and transformations used to prepare the data in this project.  The project covers the final course work for the Getting and Cleaning data course

## The data source

* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Description of the data : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## The source data (for reference only, this data is used by the script)

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.



## The result data

Includes the following files
- run_analysis.R : script which produces the tidy dataset (avg_data.csv)
- README.md : information about the functions of the script file
- CodeBook.md : this file
- avg_data.csv : results of running the script file against the source data described above. This includes calculated average values for each of the mean and std fields in the source data grouped by Activity and Subject.
- working_data.csv : not included, but will be generated and saved by the script when run for the purpose of debugging and further analysis since generating this file is costly and it contains valuable information.


# Tidy Data set variables for avg_data.csv:
##Activity is feature set of one of the following:
|Activity Name      |Activity Number |
|-------------------|:--------------:|
|WALKING|1|
|WALKING_UPSTAIRS|2|
|WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS|3|
|SITTING|4|
|STANDING|5|
|LAYING|6|
##Subject is a feature set of one of the 30 test subjects (1-30).
##The rest of the columns are the average for the related source data value column (of the same name).
